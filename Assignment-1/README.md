# Assignment-1

Due date: 23rd August 2021

Objectives

You are asked to write a program that computes how to dispense change after a purchase. The
learning objective for this assignment is to implement your first project using sequential
algorithm. A sequential algorithm is a simple algorithm which just executes a series of
statements one right after the other. You are not required to use any decision making or looping
in this program.

Discussion

In Sri Lanka, Rs. 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000 and 5000 denominations of paper
and coins are used.

The program should prompt the user for the amount of purchase, the amount of cash tendered,
and then output the change by the number of coins or bills to dispense. In order to keep the
program strictly sequential, print out denominations even when they are zero.
Algorithm

You are to design your own algorithm for this assignment, but here are some technical hints to
get around issues that you will run into. A major part of the assignment is to figure out how
many of a denomination can fit into an amount, and what amount is left over after taking out
the denomination. In C/C++, this is accomplished using two operators. The division (/)
operator can tell you how many of a denomination fit into an amount if it is used with integer
operands. The modulo (%) operator can tell you the amount left over after an integer division.
